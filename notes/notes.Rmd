# What is the aim?

- for a given date, extract rainfall data for point locations or polygons

- The program should be able to do this for multiple days
  
- the programmm will return a named list

- the names of the elements in the list are the dates we want to extract, e.g.

- and the elements in the list are spatial dataframes (with the number of rows beeing the number of points or polygons)

```{r resultexample, echo=F}
# this is the case for a single point or a single polygon
# One dataframe per day
result = list("20190101" = data.frame(date=NA, t_1 = NA, t_2=NA), "20190102" = data.frame(date=NA, t_1 = NA, t_2=NA), "20190103"=data.frame(date=NA, t_1 = NA, t_2=NA))
print(result)
```

# points

# polygons

- when extracting the data for polygons an aggregation function needs to be supplied


## Multiple object (MULTIPOINT OR MULTIPOLYGON)

- nothing changes for the points. Each row in the sf-object just gets the values

- Same for the polygons. Just as above a function needs to be supplied in order to aggregate the polygons
